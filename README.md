# Torpedo Dueling Championship (TDC)

TDC is a starblast mod which is being built by AY_KE, and Rock Castle. 
Originally Rock Castle had got this idea of dueling with torpedoes, and then 
AY_KE supported it, and promised to help out in the mod development. 

So basically the mod is going to work as following:
- 2 players join the game
- Then they are spawned to the star where torpedoes spawn
- They go away from each other, and come back and duel with torps
- They can also fire, but they only do more damage in huge intervals, i.e. The firing rate is low
- Asteroids are evenly spread, so torps can hit them and impact opponent with its blast radius

So that's all for the basic idea of the game, be sure to try it out!
